# RSerrano-CodeRefractor-Week1
Week 1 homework

The project is a on-the-job simulation in order to gain experience refracting, and reformatting pre-existing code to make it condensed
and efficient. One of the major changes needed is using proper HTML semantic elements, and sticking to the D.R.Y method in CSS. 

This condensed version allows for a more accessible webpage, which essentially means it's easier to read and follow. Versus to how it was 
originally. No changes to the webpage content, pictures, or even links. Everything looks the same upon activation, however, the 
code is much neater, which was the point of this on-the-job experience.
