# RSerrano-CodeRefractor-Week1
Week 1 homework

The project is a on-the-job simulation in order to gain experience refracting, and reformating pre-existing code to make it condensed
and neater. One of the major changes needed is using proper semantic elements, and sticking to the D.R.Y method in CSS. 

This condensed version allows for a more accessible webpage, which essentially means it's easier to read and follow versus to how it was 
originally. No changes to the webpages links, content, pictures, or even links. Everything looks the same upon activation, however, the 
code is much needer which was the point of being hired.
